A minimal task manager built with vanilla JavaScript to explore state-driven UI rendering without frameworks.

The project focuses on:

- Centralized state management
- Derived UI rendering
- LocalStorage persistence
- Avoiding magic strings
- Conditional UI visibility
- Perceived performance improvements (FOUC mitigation)
